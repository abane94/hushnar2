Silver jacks are a group of lumberjacks and forest rangers that are based out of [[Spring Lodge]]. They spend their time surveying the forest making sure everything is going well and there are no hostile creatures endangering Spring Lodge. All the wood that they harvest from the forest is sent down the Windfall River to be sold in Hillshire to any merchants traveling through the area.They also are rumored to know a lot about the horticulture of the forest and know the location of several of the rare Crying Willow trees.
