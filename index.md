The island of [[Hushnar]] is one of many islands in the misty veil. The Misty Veil is a expanse of wondrous and mysterious magical lands that were once thought to be abandoned and cut off from the rest of the world. But in recent times people have been able to navigate the [[Mawing Straight]] and sail to these Northern expanses. This has led to many explorers and frontiersmen traveling to these far away lands looking for riches and ancient ruins. It is not for the faint of heart though. These lands are usually wrought with beasts and harsh living conditions. A few hundred of these tough individuals have made their home on Hushnar.
