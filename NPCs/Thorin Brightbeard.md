Thorin Brightbeard is overall a jolly dwarf and has not seemed to been tainted by the living conditions of Slagway. He is the one that started the Miners Guild and has been as leader ever since. He has used the wealth that has been accumulated by the miners to build a respectable Guild but is slow and going because of the living conditions. Thorin is always willing to have a pint and talk but when the conversation turns to ore he becomes all business. He's always willing to invite new Guild members into service but due to the finding of Vale Stone this can be a tragic process. Thorin keeps this process though because he believes if someone is willing to go into the mines to find the stone they are tough enough to last in Slagway.
