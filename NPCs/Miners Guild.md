Miners Guild is a organization on Hushnar that helps facilitate essay for mining environment. Guild members are paid out on what they bring back from the mines daily. The Guild then transports the ore down the Comet River to then be sold in Hillshire. Some of the funds from the sales go back to hiring protections for the minors and ensuring that beasts and other creatures stay away from the mining area. The rest of the funds go to expanding the mine. It is extremely frowned upon and a large slight to the Guild if one is found mining in the guild area without permissions. The mine area is clearly marked with runestones on the surface. Any underground tunnels or passages are also marked at the boundary lines between the guild areas. One can receive permissions from The Guild in the form of a waiver. This is normally a temporary waiver usually costing coin and only lasting a few weeks. If one wishes to continue mining in the area they must become a guild member. This usually involves a rite of passage in the form of diving deep into the mine and returning with a Vale Stone. It may seem like a easy task but Vale Stone ore is extremely rare and one can't simply find a vein and come back with it. They must first talk to the guild leader [[Thorin Brightbeard]].
