 Ozric Boulder brow is a massive dwarf standing almost nearly 5 ft tall, with shoulders about as broad. He is known for his no-nonsense state of mind and does not barter well. He knows the worth of his gear and he knows that anyone willing to travel and pay the coin does as well. Ozric has currently three apprentices and only takes on only the very best pupils. One would have to show great skill from the start in order to be considered. Ozric has been also known to fire his apprentices for making what he calls shoddy work. Some say Ozric is this way because of the harshades of living in Slagway others say he's just an old grumpy dwarf. Ozric is not originally from Hushnar but traveled to the Misty Vale with his brother [[Yestar Boulderbrow]]
