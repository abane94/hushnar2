Grethna Olinoak is one of the elder Guild members. She helps out in the bunkhouse and the mess hall with any tasks that need to get done. Technically she is not a member of The Guild but more of an honorary member because he has never gone into the mines themselves. She spends her time helping out the camp as best she can. No one knows where Grethna came from and she does not like to talk about her past. The rumor goes that she popped out of the Comet River one day and just started helping out the straggling miners.
