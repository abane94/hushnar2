Otto grew up on a farm far to the south of the Misty Vale. He had never planned to make it this far but due to some unseen circumstances he found himself on a boat traveling into the unknown. When he arrived on Hushnar he found that he had no coin for the return journey so he started his services as a ferrier. Since that day roughly around 7 years ago Auto has found that he enjoys living in Flatmire quite a lot and does not plan to leave anytime soon.
