Wilburn blackwood is a dark-skinned dwarf with a big black beard giving him the for look as if he is constantly covered in soot. His forge the Comet's Tail is the only dwarven establishment in Spring Lodge. He has been in Spring Lodge since it's founding roughly around ten years ago. No one knows if Wilburn is a native dwarf to Hushnar or if he is a traveler like many of the others that call Hushnar are their home now. This is due to him being a very seclusive dwarf and mainly only talking about his work.
