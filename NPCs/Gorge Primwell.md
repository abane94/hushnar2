Gorge Primwell is a classically trained human blacksmith. Gorge was taught from a young age to swing a hammer in some of the most prestigious forges south of the Vale. When the synthetic Vale stones were created and people started traveling to the Misty veil again Gorge saw his opportunity. He packed up his shop and took his apprentices with him to the Misty Vale. Being classically trained and from a higher class background other smiths, especially  [[Ozric Boulderbrow]], see Gorge is a bit of a pompous git.
