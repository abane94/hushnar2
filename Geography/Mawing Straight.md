The Mawing Straight is a dangerous ocean filled with leviathans and massive ice flows. This expanse of water separates the Misty Vale from the rest of the world. Once travelled with some regularity much fortune was brought from the Misty Vale through the Mawing Straight. This changed though roughly 75 years ago when the Orcs for Nilith sunk the [[North Star]]. The North Star was a vessel in the Way finders Guild and was transporting the only known [[Vale Stone]] south of the straight. The Vale Stone was lost when the North Star Sunk. From that day until roughly 5 years ago no ship sailed the straight. What changed was the invention of new synthetic Vale Stone by a Gnomish inventor. Compared to the manuscripts these synthetic Vale Stone do not hold all of the abilities of a true Vale stone but they do allow competent sailors to navigate through the Mawing Straight into the Misty Vale.
