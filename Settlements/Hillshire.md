### Lore 
Hillshire is the largest and oldest city on the island of [[Hushnar]]. Having been founded long before the re-emergence of [[Vale Stone]]s. It is rumored that Hillshire dates back to the original times of traveling the Misty Vale. 

Hillshire is the trade hub of the island. The other three newer settlements all started as branches of Hillshire. They all bring their wares down from the countryside to be traded in the markets in Hillshire. Having the largest population out of any of the other settlements Hillshire has developed a rudimentary government with a mayor who overlooks all of the day-to-day tasks and decision making of the town. The mayor of Hillshire is currently [[Arthur Underhill]] they barely man with a sensible head on his shoulders. 

Hillshire is usually the stepping stone for any traveler looking to find their glory on the island. With many resources and other supply sellers in and around the town. Though a lot of the long-term residents will warn anyone wishing to seek a quick coin out in the wilderness because it's not for the faint of heart.
