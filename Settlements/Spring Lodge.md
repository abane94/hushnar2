### Lore 
Spring Lodge is a logging settlement. The workers that live here collect wood from the forest, bring it to Spring Lodge, and then eventually they run it down the [[Windfall River]] to [[Shire Bay]]. The lumber is then transported to [[Hillshire]] and sold to merchants there. The [[Crying Nettle Forest]] surrounds Spring Lodge and is particularly dangerous especially at night. Travelers are instructed to always stay on the road less they be whisked away into the forest by some Faye or beast. This connection to to the magical energies has led to a higher concentration of Forest nymphs and spirits. This makes logging especially dangerous but the wood is very high quality and is said to have magical powers. A staff made from a crying Willow from the Crying Nettle Forest is said to have the powers to bring back the Dead.
